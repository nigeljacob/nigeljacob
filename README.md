## Something about myself !
I'm a skilled Software Engineering student close to completing my Bachelor's degree. I'm adept at writing efficient code and understand how software works inside out. I've created user-friendly web and mobile applications that showcase my abilities. I love working with others, often participating in coding events and team projects. I keep up with the latest tech trends to make sure my work stays modern and effective. I'm excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to an industry role, and I'm ready to contribute to companies looking to push technology forward in a user-friendly way.
